## Smart Pools

One very powerful feature of Balancer is the concept of Smart Pools. A smart contract controlled pool can fully emulate a finalized pool, while also allowing complex logic to readjust balances, weights, and fees.

This section provides details for Balancer's reference Smart Pool contract implementation, the Configurable Rights Pool \(CRP\).

For a step by step guide on developing with the CRP and details on possible Smart Pool use cases please also see:
