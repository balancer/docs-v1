## Hacking & Testing

The [contracts are opensource](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-core) and everything is deployed on Kovan as well as Mainnet.

We use the Subgraph to make it easy to query data \(Repo: [balancer-subgraph](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-subgraph)\).

There are also apps for Pool Management and Token Exchanges. The source code for these are also available \([Exchange](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-exchange), [Pool Management](https://github.com/balancer-labs/pool-management)\).
