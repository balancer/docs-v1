## Judging

* Novel and innovative uses of Balancer are great to see. 
* Provide a short presentation or video that explains your idea, how it uses Balancer and where the project could go next.
* Your code should be available on Github with a Readme describing how to run it. 
* Bonus for good documentation!
* A deployed and publicly available UI allows us to interact and get a feel for your project.
* If your project involved creating Solidity contracts make use of a testnet to deploy, test and hook up your UI.
* Have fun!
