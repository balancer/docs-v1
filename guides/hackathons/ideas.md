## Ideas

We’re excited to see what you could build and to get you started here’s some ideas:

* [Smart pool ideas](https://app.gitbook.com/@balancer/s/balancer/~/drafts/-MHuBkdyygP9En7KTcm4/guides/smart-pool-templates-gui)
* UI template for [liquidity bootstrapping pools](https://balancer.finance/2020/03/04/building-liquidity-into-token-distribution/) \(inspiration from [Perp](https://medium.com/@perpetualprotocol/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-liquidity-bootstrapping-pool-lbp-60a61b368c82)\)
* Liquidity bootstrapping pool template with configurable curve
* Trading between a BPT and one of its underlying tokens \(e.g. BTC++/WBTC\)
* Smart pool with incentivized bonding curve "Loyalty Pools":
  * early LPs get more BPT per liquidity
  * LPs who withdraw later get more tokens per BPT.
* Other smart pools that use Balancer’s customizable weights and fees in interesting ways
* Balancer Pool DAO - BPT holders can vote on changing fees, etc
* Arbitrage using flashloans
